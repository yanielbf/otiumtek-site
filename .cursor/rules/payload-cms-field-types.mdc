# Payload CMS Field Types

**IMPORTANT:** Before implementing or modifying any field, always visit https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/overview to ensure you are using the most current field definitions and that your implementation will pass validation. This helps keep field usage up-to-date and compliant with Payload's latest standards.

**TIP**: Always avoid visiting a link unless the description directly matches your implementation need. Most fields are very purpose-specific.

If unsure between two similar fields (e.g., `Select` vs `Radio`, or `Text` vs `Textarea`), this guide prioritizes general-use recommendations and links to documentation that provide usage examples and configuration tips.
